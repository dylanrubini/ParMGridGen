IMPORTANT NOTE From Dylan Rubini:

in MGridGen the errexit utility function has been replaced with
errexit2 to prevent multiple definitions errors when linked 
with metis libary

- Additional changes should be seem in git history

- output files names changed for stand-alone program 

- extra command line variables addeed for mgrid levels 

- extra lines in output coarse grid graph file
